                        <strong><p>Who is this so called Josiah?</p></strong>
                        <p>Josiah is currently a U.W.I student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.
                        Hopelessly following a path of Computer Systems, Josiah has a passion for all things 1's and 0's!
                        He also enjoys aesthetics for some unknown reason, amplifying his desire for design and Front-End Dev.
                        As such he develops brands, develop and design websites, call-cards and... anything else really.
                        Similar to his dad, he creates and edits small movies, promos and advertisments...even animation!
                        <br>At the end of the day however, its all about technology.</p>  
                        <p>Another passion of his, is music. With the ability to play a variety of instruments, 
                        Josiah loves to produce and create anything with beat. </p>
